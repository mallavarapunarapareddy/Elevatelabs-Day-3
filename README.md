The customer_dim.csv file is a customer dimension table typically used in data analysis environments. It contains information about individual customers, including a unique identifier (coustomer_key), their name, contact number, and national ID (nid). The dataset consists of 9,191 records, with most entries having complete data, although the name field has a few missing values (27 in total). The coustomer_key serves as the primary key, uniquely identifying each customer, while the nid may also act as a secondary unique identifier. This table is well-suited for joining with other datasets, such as sales or order data, to perform customer-level analysis. It can be used to create views for reporting, generate insights on customer behavior, or support business intelligence dashboards. Overall, this file provides essential foundational data for tracking and analyzing customer-related activities.
